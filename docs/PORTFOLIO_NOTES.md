# Portfolio Notes

- Keep READMEs **short at the top**, with clear TL;DR and diagrams.
- Use **Mermaid** for architecture (GitHub renders it).
- Add **topics** so your repos are discoverable.
- Pin your favorite stacks to your profile.
- Consider adding a GitHub Pages site later (MkDocs or Docusaurus).
